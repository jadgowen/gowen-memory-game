## Instructions

The goal of the Memory Game is to successfully match pairs of cards in the fewest number of moves and least amount of time.

The game begins on the first click of a card as indicated by the timer. At any time, the player can reset the game by clicking the reset button just above the playing board.

Players begin with a score of 4 stars, and as the number of moves increases, the number of stars begins to decline.


## Comments

## Dependencies

The project references scripts in its css folder and js folder as well as a Google font for the text and a Bootstrap font for the card symbols.
